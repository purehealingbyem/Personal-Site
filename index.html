								<h2>About Reiki</h2>
							</header>
							<h3>Reiki: Healing with Universal Energy</h3>
							<p>Reiki is a powerful, ancient energy healing practice that originated in Japan. Derived from the Japanese words “Rei” meaning "universal" and “Ki” meaning "life energy," Reiki is based on the belief that we all have an unseen life force energy that flows through us and around us. When this energy is balanced and flowing freely, we experience physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Reiki aims to restore harmony and balance by channeling this universal energy to promote healing and reduce stress.</p>
							
							<h3>The Origins and Evolution of Reiki</h3>
							<p>Reiki was developed by Mikao Usui in the early 20th century. After years of studying ancient healing texts and undergoing deep meditation, Usui is said to have experienced a profound spiritual awakening on Mount Kurama, where he discovered how to access and direct healing energy. Usui's teachings spread, and over the decades, Reiki became popular worldwide, evolving into different forms and styles of energy healing.</p>
							
							<h3>Tara Mai Reiki</h3>
							<p>Tara Mai is a branch of Reiki that blends traditional Usui Reiki with other ancient healing systems and shamanic practices. Founded by Kathleen Milner, Tara Mai combines elements of Reiki with Seichem, a powerful Egyptian healing system. Tara Mai Reiki practitioners often work with earth energy, fire, air, and water elements to enhance the healing process. Kathleen Milner's vision was to open up healing to a broader range of frequencies, incorporating higher vibrations that align with spiritual transformation and awakening.</p>
							
							<h3>Seichem: Egyptian Energy Healing</h3>
							<p>Seichem is an extension of Reiki, rooted in the healing traditions of ancient Egypt. While Reiki focuses primarily on the Earth element, Seichem expands this by incorporating the four elements: Earth (Reiki), Water (Sophi-el), Air (Angel-light), and Fire (Sakara). Each element corresponds to different aspects of healing. For example, Sakara (Fire energy) is said to ignite personal power and transformation, while Sophi-el (Water energy) brings emotional healing and love. Practitioners of Seichem often feel a stronger connection to the energy during sessions, as it operates on multiple energetic levels.</p>
							
							<h3>Reiki, Tara Mai, and Seichem: A Path to Holistic Healing</h3>
							<p>Whether you're receiving traditional Reiki or a session that incorporates Tara Mai and Seichem, the goal remains the same: to balance the mind, body, and spirit. These healing systems offer profound experiences of inner peace, emotional clarity, and spiritual awakening, opening the door to a deeper understanding of ourselves and our place in the universe.</p>

									<h2>About Me</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Life has taken me on an incredible journey across the globe, allowing me to live in several different countries, each experience enriching my perspective on the world. Before and after completing my studies, I spent time in <strong>Australia</strong>, a place that left a lasting impression on my heart. Eventually, I settled in <strong>Ireland</strong>, where I worked for eight years in various corporate roles. The work was fulfilling, and I was fortunate to travel during this time, discovering new cultures and deepening my understanding of life’s many facets.</p>
								
								<p>However, after being made redundant from my job, I realised it was time to focus on something I had been drawn to for years: <strong>Reiki</strong>. I had always felt a deep connection to energy healing, but life kept taking me in other directions. Suddenly, the path was clear—this was my opportunity to embark on a journey of personal growth and transformation, not just for myself, but for others as well.</p>
								
								<p>Through Reiki, I now channel my passion for holistic healing, helping others find balance, peace, and clarity in their lives, just as I did in mine. Each session is a new opportunity to connect with the universal energy that surrounds us all, offering healing and harmony to those who seek it.</p>
